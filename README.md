# Music-Genre-Classification

Using inter-feature, feature-targeted correlation and feature selection methods like Recursive Feature Extraction to analyse the spectral features of different musical genres and categorise new music into its respective genre.

**Problem Statement**: The objective is to identify the genre of the song given a set of spectral features

Tasks: Identify potential features of individual genres to identify the types of music genres. Design novel feature selection framework  or use the existing techniques with proper justifications to identify salient features of the given data. Report the performance of different classification techniques on the training data to demonstrate that the proposed feature selection scheme is working well. You can also propose a novel classification framework for this problem. Subsequently, execute the best framework on the test data and submit the class labels in a text file. Each row of the text file will contain the serial number of each test data point followed by the class label separated by a comma e.g., d1, genre_type.
